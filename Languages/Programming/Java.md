# Java

## Brief Definition
Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent. It follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle, making it one of the most popular languages for enterprise software development.

## Historical Context
Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java was originally designed for interactive television but evolved into a general-purpose programming language. It was acquired by Oracle in 2010 and continues to be widely used in enterprise applications.

## Core Concepts
- Platform independence through JVM
- Strong static typing
- Object-oriented programming
- Automatic memory management
- Exception handling
- Multi-threading support
- Reflection
- Generics
- Lambda expressions (Java 8+)

## Implementation
```java
// Class definition
public class Person {
    private String name;
    
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public String greet() {
        return "Hello, I'm " + name;
    }
}

// Interface
public interface Greeter {
    String greet();
}

// Lambda expression
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Bob");
names.forEach(name -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name));
```

## Examples
```java
// Exception handling
try {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("file.txt");
    // Process file
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.err.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    // Cleanup code
}

// Collections
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
numbers.add(1);
numbers.add(2);
numbers.stream()
    .filter(n -> n > 1)
    .forEach(System.out::println);

// Thread creation
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running in new thread");
});
thread.start();
```

## Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:
- Platform independence
- Strong type safety
- Rich standard library
- Excellent performance
- Enterprise-grade security
- Large ecosystem
- Strong community support

Limitations:
- Verbose syntax
- Memory overhead
- Slower startup time
- Less flexible than dynamic languages
- Limited functional programming features
- Complex generics system
