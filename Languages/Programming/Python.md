# Python

## Brief Definition
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Historical Context
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python was designed to emphasize code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. The language's philosophy is summarized in "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

## Core Concepts
- Dynamic typing and automatic memory management
- Interpreted language with bytecode compilation
- Extensive standard library
- Indentation-based code blocks
- Everything is an object
- Duck typing
- List comprehensions and generators
- Decorators and metaclasses

## Implementation
```python
# Basic syntax examples
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

# Class definition
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
    
    def greet(self) -> str:
        return f"Hello, I'm {self.name}"
```

## Examples
```python
# Data structures
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dictionary = {"key": "value", "number": 42}

# File handling
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

# Error handling
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
```

## Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:
- Readable and maintainable code
- Large ecosystem of libraries
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Strong community support
- Great for prototyping and rapid development

Limitations:
- Slower execution speed compared to compiled languages
- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallel processing
- Not ideal for mobile development
- Dynamic typing can lead to runtime errors
