# Swift

## Brief Definition
Swift is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Apple for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development. It combines the performance of compiled languages with the safety and expressiveness of modern scripting languages.

## Historical Context
Created by Chris Lattner and others at Apple in 2010, Swift was designed to replace Objective-C as the primary language for Apple platform development. It was released publicly in 2014 and has become the preferred language for Apple ecosystem development.

## Core Concepts
- Type safety and type inference
- Protocol-oriented programming
- Optionals and nil handling
- Closures and higher-order functions
- Extensions
- Generics
- Pattern matching
- Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
- Protocol extensions
- Result builders

## Implementation
```swift
// Function definition
func greet(name: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}

// Class definition
class Person {
    let name: String
    var age: Int?
    
    init(name: String, age: Int? = nil) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
    
    func greet() -> String {
        return "Hello, I'm \(name)"
    }
}

// Protocol
protocol Greeter {
    func greet() -> String
}
```

## Examples
```swift
// Optional handling
func processOptional(value: String?) {
    if let unwrapped = value {
        print("Value is \(unwrapped)")
    }
    
    // Using guard
    guard let name = person.name else {
        return
    }
    print("Hello, \(name)")
}

// Result type
enum Result<Success, Failure> {
    case success(Success)
    case failure(Failure)
}

// Async/await
func fetchData() async throws -> Data {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data")!
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return data
}
```

## Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:
- Modern syntax and features
- Strong type safety
- Excellent performance
- Interoperability with Objective-C
- Great IDE support
- Active community
- Regular updates

Limitations:
- Limited to Apple platforms
- Smaller ecosystem than other languages
- Learning curve for complex features
- Some features only available in newer versions
- Limited cross-platform support
- Dependency on Apple's tooling
