# JavaScript

## Brief Definition
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. It can be used both on the client-side and server-side (Node.js).

## Historical Context
Created by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape Navigator, JavaScript was originally called LiveScript. It was renamed to JavaScript as a marketing strategy to capitalize on Java's popularity. The language has evolved significantly through ECMAScript standards.

## Core Concepts
- Dynamic typing
- Prototype-based object orientation
- First-class functions
- Event-driven programming
- Asynchronous programming with Promises
- Closures and scope
- Hoisting
- Modules and packages
- DOM manipulation

## Implementation
```javascript
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Arrow function
const square = (x) => x * x;

// Class definition
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    greet() {
        return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`;
    }
}
```

## Examples
```javascript
// Async/await
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}

// Array methods
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(x => x * 2);
const filtered = numbers.filter(x => x > 3);

// Object destructuring
const { name, age, ...rest } = person;
```

## Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:
- Ubiquitous in web development
- Large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Active community and regular updates
- Great for rapid prototyping

Limitations:
- Inconsistent behavior across browsers
- No built-in type system (though TypeScript addresses this)
- Callback hell (though async/await helps)
- Limited access to system resources in browser
- Single-threaded nature
