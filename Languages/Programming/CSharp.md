# C#

## Brief Definition
C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. It combines the power of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic and is particularly well-suited for Windows desktop applications, web development, and game development with Unity.

## Historical Context
Created by Anders Hejlsberg and his team at Microsoft in 2000, C# was designed to be a modern, type-safe language for the .NET platform. It has evolved significantly through multiple versions, with each version adding new features and improvements.

## Core Concepts
- Strong static typing
- Object-oriented programming
- Component-oriented programming
- LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- Async/await for asynchronous programming
- Properties and events
- Delegates and lambda expressions
- Generics
- Nullable reference types
- Pattern matching

## Implementation
```csharp
// Class definition
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    
    public Person(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
    
    public string Greet() => $"Hello, I'm {Name}";
}

// Interface
public interface IGreeter
{
    string Greet();
}

// LINQ example
var numbers = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
```

## Examples
```csharp
// Async/await
public async Task<string> FetchDataAsync()
{
    try
    {
        using var client = new HttpClient();
        return await client.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
        return null;
    }
}

// Pattern matching
public string GetShapeDescription(Shape shape) => shape switch
{
    Circle c => $"Circle with radius {c.Radius}",
    Rectangle r => $"Rectangle {r.Width}x{r.Height}",
    _ => "Unknown shape"
};

// Properties
public class User
{
    private string _name;
    public string Name
    {
        get => _name;
        set => _name = value ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value));
    }
}
```

## Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:
- Strong type safety
- Excellent IDE support
- Rich standard library
- Great performance
- Strong integration with Windows
- Modern language features
- Large ecosystem

Limitations:
- Primarily Windows-focused
- Less flexible than dynamic languages
- Learning curve for .NET ecosystem
- Limited cross-platform support (though improving)
- Memory management complexity
