# R

## Brief Definition
R is a programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical visualization. It's widely used in data science, machine learning, and statistical research.

## Historical Context
Created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in 1993, R is an implementation of the S programming language. It has become the de facto standard for statistical computing and data analysis in academia and industry.

## Core Concepts
- Vector-based operations
- Statistical functions
- Data frames
- Factor variables
- Lists and matrices
- Package management
- Graphics and visualization
- Functional programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Data import/export

## Implementation
```r
# Function definition
greet <- function(name) {
    paste("Hello,", name)
}

# Data frame creation
df <- data.frame(
    name = c("John", "Jane", "Bob"),
    age = c(25, 30, 35),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Vector operations
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
squared <- numbers^2
```

## Examples
```r
# Data analysis
# Load data
data(mtcars)

# Basic statistics
summary(mtcars)

# Linear regression
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)
summary(model)

# Visualization
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(title = "MPG vs Weight")
```

## Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:
- Comprehensive statistical tools
