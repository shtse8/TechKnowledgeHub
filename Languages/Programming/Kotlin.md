# Kotlin

## Brief Definition
Kotlin is a modern, concise programming language that runs on the JVM and can be compiled to JavaScript or native code. It's designed to be fully interoperable with Java and is the preferred language for Android development.

## Historical Context
Developed by JetBrains and first released in 2011, Kotlin was designed to address Java's limitations while maintaining full compatibility. It became the official language for Android development in 2017 and has gained significant popularity in the Android ecosystem.

## Core Concepts
- Null safety
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming
- Data classes
- Extension functions
- Smart casts
- Type inference
- Operator overloading
- Property delegation
- Sealed classes
- Multiplatform support

## Implementation
```kotlin
// Function definition
fun greet(name: String): String = "Hello, $name!"

// Data class
data class Person(
    val name: String,
    var age: Int? = null
)

// Extension function
fun String.addExclamation(): String = "$this!"

// Interface
interface Greeter {
    fun greet(): String
}
```

## Examples
```kotlin
// Null safety
fun processNullable(value: String?) {
    value?.let { println("Value is $it") }
    
    // Elvis operator
    val length = value?.length ?: 0
}

// Coroutines
suspend fun fetchData(): String {
    return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // Simulated network call
        delay(1000)
        "Data from network"
    }
}

// Sealed class
sealed class Result<out T> {
    data class Success<T>(val data: T) : Result<T>()
    data class Error(val message: String) : Result<Nothing>()
}
```

## Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:
- Full Java interoperability
- Null safety
