# Rust

## Brief Definition
Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, concurrency, and performance. It provides memory safety without garbage collection and prevents common programming errors through its ownership system and strong type checking.

## Historical Context
Created by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research in 2010, Rust was designed to be a safer alternative to C++ for systems programming. It has gained significant popularity for its unique approach to memory safety and its growing ecosystem.

## Core Concepts
- Ownership and borrowing system
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Pattern matching
- Type inference
- No null values
- No garbage collection
- Thread safety guarantees
- Macros
- Cargo package manager
- Safe concurrency

## Implementation
```rust
// Function definition
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

// Struct definition
struct Person {
    name: String,
}

impl Person {
    fn new(name: String) -> Self {
        Person { name }
    }
    
    fn greet(&self) -> String {
        format!("Hello, I'm {}", self.name)
    }
}

// Enum with pattern matching
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

## Examples
```rust
// Ownership and borrowing
fn process_string(s: String) {
    println!("Processing: {}", s);
    // s is dropped here
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    process_string(s); // s is moved here
    // println!("{}", s); // This would fail - s is no longer valid
}

// Error handling with Result
fn read_file(path: &str) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
    std::fs::read_to_string(path)
}

// Concurrent programming
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        println!("Hello from a thread!");
    });
    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

## Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Thread safety guarantees
- Zero-cost abstractions

- Modern tooling (Cargo)
- Strong type system
- Growing ecosystem

Limitations:
- Steep learning curve
- Longer compilation times
- Smaller ecosystem than older languages
- Limited GUI support
- Complex ownership rules
- Less mature IDE support
