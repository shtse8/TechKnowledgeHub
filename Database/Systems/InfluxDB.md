# InfluxDB

## Brief Definition
InfluxDB is a time series database designed to handle high write and query loads for time series data. It's optimized for storing and analyzing time-stamped data, making it ideal for monitoring, analytics, and IoT applications.

## Historical Context
Created by Paul Dix in 2013, InfluxDB was developed to address the specific needs of time series data storage and analysis. It has become one of the most popular time series databases, particularly in monitoring and IoT applications.

## Core Concepts
- Time series data
- Series
- Points
- Tags and fields
- Retention policies
- Continuous queries
- Flux query language
- Buckets
- Organizations
- Tasks

## Implementation
```javascript
// Write data points
const points = [
    {
        measurement: 'temperature',
        tags: {
            location: 'room1',
            device: 'sensor1'
        },
        fields: {
            value: 22.5,
            humidity: 45
        },
        timestamp: new Date()
    }
];

// Create bucket
const bucket = {
    name: 'sensors',
    retentionRules: [{
        type: 'expire',
        everySeconds: 86400 * 30 // 30 days
    }]
};

// Create continuous query
const query = `
    CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY "hourly_temperature"
    ON "sensors"
    BEGIN
        SELECT mean("value") INTO "hourly_temperature"
        FROM "temperature"
        GROUP BY time(1h)
    END
`;
```

## Examples
```javascript
// Query with aggregation
const query = `
    from(bucket: "sensors")
        |> range(start: -1h)
        |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "temperature")
        |> mean()
`;

// Complex query with windowing
const complexQuery = `
    from(bucket: "sensors")
        |> range(start: -24h)
        |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "temperature")
        |> window(every: 1h)
        |> mean()
        |> yield(name: "hourly_avg")
`;

// Alert query
const alertQuery = `
    from(bucket: "sensors")
        |> range(start: -5m)
        |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "temperature")
        |> mean()
        |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_value"] > 30)
`;
```
