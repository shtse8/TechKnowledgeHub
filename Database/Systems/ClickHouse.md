# ClickHouse

## Brief Definition
ClickHouse is a column-oriented database management system for online analytical processing (OLAP). It's designed for high-performance analytical queries and real-time data processing, making it ideal for big data analytics and data warehousing.

## Historical Context
Created by Yandex in 2016, ClickHouse was developed to power Yandex.Metrica, one of the world's largest web analytics platforms. It was open-sourced and has become a popular choice for analytical databases.

## Core Concepts
- Column-oriented storage
- OLAP optimization
- Data compression
- Distributed architecture
- MergeTree engine
- Materialized views
- Window functions
- Array and nested types
- Data sharding
- Data replication

## Implementation
```sql
-- Create table with MergeTree engine
CREATE TABLE events
(
    event_date Date,
    event_type String,
    user_id UInt32,
    event_time DateTime,
    properties Nested(
        key String,
        value String
    )
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(event_date)
ORDER BY (event_type, event_time);

-- Create materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW event_counts
ENGINE = SummingMergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(event_date)
ORDER BY (event_type)
AS SELECT
    event_date,
    event_type,
    count() as count
FROM events
GROUP BY event_date, event_type;
```

## Examples
```sql
-- Complex analytical query
SELECT
    event_type,
    count() as event_count,
    uniqExact(user_id) as unique_users,
    avg(properties.value[indexOf(properties.key, 'duration')]) as avg_duration
FROM events
WHERE event_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY event_count DESC;

-- Window functions
SELECT
    event_type,
    event_time,
    count() OVER (PARTITION BY event_type ORDER BY event_time ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as running_count
FROM events
WHERE event_date = '2024-03-20'
ORDER BY event_type, event_time;

-- Array operations
SELECT
    event_type,
    groupArray(user_id) as user_ids,
    groupArrayDistinct(user_id) as unique_user_ids
FROM events
WHERE event_date = '2024-03-20'
GROUP BY event_type;
```
