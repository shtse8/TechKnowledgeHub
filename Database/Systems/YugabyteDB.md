# YugabyteDB

## Brief Definition
YugabyteDB is a distributed SQL database that provides PostgreSQL compatibility with horizontal scalability and strong consistency. It's designed for cloud-native applications requiring both SQL capabilities and distributed features.

## Historical Context
Created by Yugabyte Inc. in 2016, YugabyteDB was developed to address the challenges of building distributed applications while maintaining PostgreSQL compatibility. It was designed to provide a familiar SQL interface with the scalability of NoSQL systems.

## Core Concepts
- PostgreSQL compatibility
- Distributed architecture
- Strong consistency
- Horizontal scaling
- ACID compliance
- SQL support
- Automatic sharding
- Data replication
- Backup and restore
- Multi-region support

## Implementation
```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    profile JSONB
);

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);

-- Create view
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT username, email
FROM users
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## Examples
```sql
-- Complex query with joins
SELECT 
    u.username,
    COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY u.id, u.username
HAVING total_orders > 0
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- JSON operations
SELECT 
    username,
    profile->>'location' as location,
    profile->'interests' as interests
FROM users
WHERE profile->>'location' = 'New York';

-- Window functions
SELECT 
    user_id,
    order_date,
    total_amount,
    SUM(total_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id 
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as running_total
FROM orders;
```
