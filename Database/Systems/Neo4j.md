# Neo4j

## Brief Definition
Neo4j is a native graph database that stores, manages, and analyzes data relationships. It's designed to handle complex, interconnected data structures efficiently, making it ideal for applications requiring deep relationship analysis and traversal.

## Historical Context
Created by Neo Technology in 2007, Neo4j was developed to address the limitations of traditional databases in handling connected data. It has become the leading graph database, widely used in applications requiring relationship analysis, recommendation engines, and network analysis.

## Core Concepts
- Graph data model
- Nodes and relationships
- Properties
- Cypher query language
- Graph algorithms
- Indexing
- ACID compliance
- Native graph storage
- Graph traversal
- Path finding

## Implementation
```cypher
// Create nodes with properties
CREATE (user:User {
    id: 'u1',
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    created_at: datetime()
})

// Create relationships
CREATE (user:User {name: 'John'})
CREATE (product:Product {name: 'Laptop'})
CREATE (user)-[:PURCHASED {
    date: date(),
    amount: 999.99
}]->(product)

// Create indexes
CREATE INDEX user_id_index FOR (u:User) ON (u.id)
CREATE INDEX product_name_index FOR (p:Product) ON (p.name)
```

## Examples
```cypher
// Complex graph traversal
MATCH (user:User {id: 'u1'})
MATCH path = (user)-[:PURCHASED*1..3]->(product:Product)
RETURN path
LIMIT 10;

// Recommendation query
MATCH (user:User {id: 'u1'})
MATCH (user)-[:PURCHASED]->(p1:Product)
MATCH (other:User)-[:PURCHASED]->(p1)
MATCH (other)-[:PURCHASED]->(p2:Product)
WHERE NOT (user)-[:PURCHASED]->(p2)
RETURN p2.name, count(*) as score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;

// Path finding
MATCH path = shortestPath(
    (start:User {id: 'u1'})-[:KNOWS*]-(end:User {id: 'u2'})
)
RETURN path;
```
