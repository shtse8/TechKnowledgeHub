# Vitess

## Brief Definition
Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. It's designed to provide database sharding, connection pooling, and query routing while maintaining MySQL compatibility and ACID properties.

## Historical Context
Created by YouTube in 2010 and later open-sourced, Vitess was developed to handle YouTube's massive MySQL database infrastructure. It has become a popular solution for scaling MySQL databases in production environments.

## Core Concepts
- MySQL compatibility
- Horizontal scaling
- Sharding
- Connection pooling
- Query routing
- ACID compliance
- Replication
- Backup and restore
- Schema management
- VTGate

## Implementation
```sql
-- Create keyspace
CREATE KEYSPACE ecommerce;

-- Create table with sharding
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

-- Create sharding key
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN keyspace_id BIGINT;

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
```

## Examples
```sql
-- Sharded query
SELECT 
    u.username,
    COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY u.id, u.username
HAVING total_orders > 0
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- Cross-shard query
SELECT 
    u.username,
    o.order_id,
    o.total_amount
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.keyspace_id IN (1, 2)
AND o.created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
ORDER BY o.total_amount DESC;

-- Schema management
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN profile JSON,
ADD INDEX idx_profile_location ((CAST(profile->>'$.location' AS CHAR(36))));
```
