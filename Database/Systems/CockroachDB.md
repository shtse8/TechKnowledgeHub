# CockroachDB

## Brief Definition
CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and strongly-consistent key-value store. It's designed to provide ACID compliance, scalability, and survivability, making it ideal for global applications requiring strong consistency.

## Historical Context
Created by Spencer Kimball, Peter Mattis, and Ben Darnell in 2015, CockroachDB was developed to address the challenges of building globally distributed applications. It was designed to provide the familiar SQL interface while offering the scalability and resilience of NoSQL systems.

## Core Concepts
- Distributed architecture
- ACID compliance
- SQL support
- Geo-distribution
- Automatic sharding
- Strong consistency
- Transaction support
- Backup and restore
- Change data capture
- Multi-region deployment

## Implementation
```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;

-- Create table with geo-partitioning
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username STRING UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email STRING UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    region STRING NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
    CONSTRAINT region_check CHECK (region IN ('us-east', 'us-west', 'eu-west'))
) PARTITION ALL BY (region);

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);

-- Create view
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT username, email, region
FROM users
WHERE created_at >= current_timestamp() - interval '30 days';
```

## Examples
```sql
-- Distributed transaction
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total_amount)
    VALUES ('user123', 99.99);
    
    UPDATE user_balance
    SET balance = balance - 99.99
    WHERE user_id = 'user123';
COMMIT;

-- Geo-distributed query
SELECT 
    region,
    count(*) as user_count,
    avg(extract(epoch from current_timestamp() - created_at)) as avg_age_days
FROM users
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY user_count DESC;

-- Complex join with distribution
SELECT 
    u.username,
    o.order_id,
    o.total_amount,
    p.product_name
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id
WHERE u.region = 'us-east'
AND o.created_at >= current_timestamp() - interval '7 days'
ORDER BY o.total_amount DESC;
```
