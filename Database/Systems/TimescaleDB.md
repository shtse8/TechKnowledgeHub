# TimescaleDB

## Brief Definition
TimescaleDB is an open-source time series database built on top of PostgreSQL. It combines the reliability and features of PostgreSQL with optimizations for time series data, making it ideal for applications requiring both relational and time series capabilities.

## Historical Context
Created by Timescale Inc. in 2017, TimescaleDB was developed to address the limitations of traditional databases in handling time series data while maintaining PostgreSQL's powerful features. It has become a popular choice for applications requiring both relational and time series capabilities.

## Core Concepts
- Hypertables
- Chunks
- Compression
- Continuous aggregates
- Time-bucket functions
- First/last value functions
- Gap filling
- Data retention
- Partitioning
- PostgreSQL compatibility

## Implementation
```sql
-- Enable TimescaleDB extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;

-- Create hypertable
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
    time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    device_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    temperature DOUBLE PRECISION,
    humidity DOUBLE PRECISION
);

-- Convert to hypertable
SELECT create_hypertable('sensor_data', 'time');

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_sensor_data_device_time 
ON sensor_data (device_id, time DESC);

-- Create continuous aggregate
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sensor_data_hourly
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT 
    time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS bucket,
    device_id,
    avg(temperature) as avg_temp,
    avg(humidity) as avg_humidity
FROM sensor_data
GROUP BY bucket, device_id;
```

## Examples
```sql
-- Time-bucket query
SELECT 
    time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS hour,
    device_id,
    avg(temperature) as avg_temp
FROM sensor_data
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour, device_id
ORDER BY hour DESC;

-- Gap filling
SELECT 
    time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS hour,
    device_id,
    first(temperature, time) as first_temp,
    last(temperature, time) as last_temp
FROM sensor_data
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour, device_id
ORDER BY hour DESC;

-- Complex aggregation
SELECT 
    time_bucket('1 day', time) AS day,
    device_id,
    avg(temperature) as avg_temp,
    max(temperature) as max_temp,
    min(temperature) as min_temp
FROM sensor_data
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY day, device_id
ORDER BY day DESC;
```
